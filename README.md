# Developer Journey Dynamic Web App

**Developer Journey App** gives developers a fun user interface for exploring a
simple maze to find and collect resources that provide technical tips.

The main goal of the app, however, is to showcase how to write [Next.js] apps
to reap the performance benefits of [Google Cloud] and [Cloud CDN].

## Launch

[![Open in Cloud Shell](https://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.svg)](https://ssh.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor?cloudshell_git_repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fgooglecloudplatform%2Fdeveloper-journey-app)

## Features

This is a demo app built with [TypeScript], [Next.js] and [React]. The app
demonstrates [Static Generation] and [Server-side Rendering]
techniques for pre-rendering cacheable pages.

This demo runs on Google Cloud using the following services:

- [Cloud Run] for scalable serverless apps
- [Cloud Firestore] for scalable serverless databases
- [Cloud CDN] for scalable content delivery and caching

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run Dev Journey locally **using your own machine**, you will need to install
the following:

- [Node.js (`LTS` version is recommended)](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk)
- [Firestore Emulator] (optional)

Installing the [Firestore Emulator] for local development is optional. If you
don't use the emulator, you will need to create a database on [Cloud Firestore]
that you can use for development and testing.

> The Google Cloud Firestore emulator requires a Java 8+ JRE installed and on
> your system PATH
>
> If you need to install Java, you can get it from here:
> https://adoptium.net/
>
> - To choose a specific version, to to: https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/
> - If you're on a Mac with an Apple Silicon M1 or M2 chip, choose the `aarch64` architecture.
> - Choose `JRE` instead of the full `JDK` package unless you plan to do Java
>   development.

### Run the app locally

1. Start the Firestore Emulator

   Choose the port you want to use for the [Firestore Emulator], for example `9999`.

   > Note: If you choose a port that is not `9999` for this demo, you will need to update the `host` property in `database.ts` to match your selected port.

   Export the `FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST` environment variable:

   ```bash
   export FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST="localhost:9999"
   ```

   When the exported `FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST` environment variable is set, the
   Firestore client will automatically use it to connect to the emulator.

   To start the emulator:

   ```bash
   gcloud emulators firestore start --host-port="$FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST"
   ```

   Press `Ctrl-C` when you want to stop the Firestore emulator.

2. Get the code

   Clone this repo and change your current working directory to it:

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/developer-journey-app.git
    cd developer-journey-app
   ```

3. Set local development environment variables

   Copy the example `.env.local.example` file to a new file `.env.local`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```

   This file is used by Next.js to define default development values such as
   `FIREBASE_EMULATOR_HOST`. If neccessary, change any of the default values
   provided.

4. Install npm dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see
   the result.

   You can start editing the application. The browser auto-refreshes when you save changes.

   > The repo's `package-lock.json` will be ignored by git if you
   > commit changes (configured in `.gitignore`).

## Tests

> Before running tests, make sure you have the Firestore Emulator running on
> your local machine on the indicated port.

To run Jest tests:

```bash
FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST="localhost:9999" npm test
```

To run Jest tests in watch mode:

```bash
FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST="localhost:9999" npm run test:watch
```

[ts-jest](https://kulshekhar.github.io/ts-jest/) is installed as a dev
dependency to support writing tests in TypeScript. The jest configuration
(`jest.config.js`) sets `preset: 'ts-jest'` to enable this.

Jest will run tests located in `__test__` directories (for example:
`src/lib/__test__/database.test.ts`).
